## Why ?
After recovering huge amounts of data on an old HDD, I had to sort and move a tremendous amount of files by hand, which is why I made this program. At first it was a simple batch script but I was tired of editing it everytime for different folders and extensions.

## What ?
It's a simple GUI file mover written in Python that allows to move files from a directory to another with extensions filtered.

## Who ?
This program will come in handy if you are in the same situation, where you have a lot of unsorted files to move and organize. This program will help you with the first step of moving recovered data from the source folder to whatever destination. E.g : I use it to move all images (with jpg, jpeg, png, cr2 etc. in the file extension field) to a specific directory, and so on.

## How ?
- Select source folder
- Select destination folder
- Type in the file extensions you want to filter, if any. (Extension only, without the "." dot)
- Click the "Move-it!" button
  - You will be prompted whether to overwrite existing files or not. If you chose not to overwrite files, they will be renamed in order to keep all of them.

This little program helps me quite a lot so I thought about sharing it. Enjoy !
